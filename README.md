# VampireSurvivorsAimPlugin

A [UCR](https://github.com/Snoothy/UCR) plugin for the game [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/) which allows setting up a controller such that while a configured button is held, the player stays still, and the right stick will aim the character in a desired direction.
